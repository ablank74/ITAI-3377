    "- Hardward Tampering:  Because these are edge devices they may be in areas that are left unsupervised, this can allow for tampering with the systems to manipulate data, allow for machine failure or return invalid data.\n",
    "- Model Corruption or Modificaiton:  Again because of the remote use of these systems, having physical access allows for the ability to make software changes to control the behavior of the reporting and detection systems.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Data\n",
    "- Buffer Overflow:  Without proper input verification, it could be possible to perform this attack by sending specialy crafted data streams as input and breaking out of programatic guard rails to run code.\n",
    "- Data Poisoning:  By manipulating data, incorrect information could be interpreted and cause unexpected behaviors\n",

    "- Model Poisoning: Using some of the previous techniques the model could be retrained with bad data leading to results that are not desirable\n",

    "#### Defense Measures\n",
    "- All software development should include security principals.  All inputs must be checked for proper type, and bounds to prevent buffer overflow possibilities.\n",
    "- All software packages should be monitored for bug notifications and throughouly QA'd in a red/blue environment before being deployed\n",
    "- DevOps and SecOps should be invovled in design decisions\n",
    "- Exploit testing and Red Team testing should be performed frequently, with any discovered vulnerabilities documented, and remediated.\n",
    "- All Enclosed spaces should use a two factor authentication system, a keycard and biometric sensor to access\n",
    "- All Analysis Endpoints should have security cameras covering the area where the device is located as well as access to the area with timestamps\n",
    "- All Analysis Endpoints should have metal enclosures with anti-tamper screws and tamper evident seals\n",
    "- All Analysis Endpoints should use boot from network protocol such as bootp/PXE Boot to ensure a consistent OS/Data installation\n",
    "- All PXE Images should be updated after patches to OS an applications have been tested and verified\n",
    "- A MDM solution should be implemented to maintain an inventory of the devices, and version information and alarms for any device that is out of spec\n",
    "- A boot process should include checksum verification of the required software and AI model to ensure that is consistent and what is expected, with any outlyer triggering an alarm\n",
    "- A Dedicated network should be designed and isolated by vlan or physical lan and monitored for unauthorized devices\n",
    "- Data should only be transmitted in encrypted methods\n",
    "- All storage devices should be encrypted at rest\n",
    "- Firewalls and network segmentation with access control to allow least access possible should be designed and enforced\n",
    "- A NOC/SOC should be implemented with a 24 hour staff to monitor and investigate all notificaitons and either clear or escalate as appropriate\n",
    "- AI Models should be trained in a clean environment before distribution, the distributed model checksum advertized and verified everywhere it is deployed.\n",
